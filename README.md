## PITCH

  Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. 

## MVP

  1. A small business `owner` can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

  2. They can also make listing for `items` they want to sell, which will show up to all `users`.

  3. They add a new `item` by selecting their market `location` and typing in their item's `name`, `description`, and `price`.
